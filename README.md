# Improved Hamming Code Algorithm

Simulation of the Improved Hamming Code Algorithm based on the improvement proposed by U.K Humar and B.S. Umashankar in their 2007 paper entitled: "Improved Hamming Code for Error Detection and Correction". The paper can be found here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4147113

I coded this program as a small simulation of how the algorithm would work on both the source node and the destination node. The Hamming Code is an error detection and correction algorithm that is able to correct 1-bit errors in raw data being transferred from device to another over a network.
